A series of labs designed to help you understand and implement various deep learning algorithms and models.

## Perceptron

- Implement the perceptron algorithm from scratch.
- Understand the impact of data distribution (by varying the standard deviation of the input data) on the model's learning process and performance.

## Multilayer Perceptron and Deep Neural Networks

- Explore how different neural network components( Activation functions, depth, width...) affect the training of a model and gain insights into the trade-offs and best practices for designing and training effective neural networks.

## CNN

- Train different CNN models to classify digit numbers of the MNIST dataset.

## RNN

- Experiment with different word embedding techniques and various RNN architectures using the IMDB dataset (as you might have guessed).
